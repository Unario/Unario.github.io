## About Me

{{< figure class="profile" src="/zhao.jpeg" width="150px" >}}

I am a software engineer at Google specialized in wireless networking.
I am on the connectivity team of Google Fi.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 from Dartmouth College
under the supervision of [Prof. Xia Zhou](http://cs.dartmouth.edu/~xia).
I was a member of [Dartmouth Networking and Ubiquitous Systems Lab](http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu/) and
[Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/).
I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. (minor) in Economics from Peking University in 2013.

I was also a visiting reseacher at Cambridge University in 2016
and a research intern at Bell Labs, Cambridge in 2017.

## Research Interest

I am a full-stack (physical to application layer) network researcher.
My current research interest lies in hybrid wireless network that combines
different modalities and its security.
My Ph.D. research was focused on visible light communication and sensing.
